## How does it work?
The website acts as a series of pages that serves as a digital showcase of the home cooked recipes that I have made.

The homepage displays grid of recipe cards. Each recipe card shows the image and name of the recipe. Clicking on the image or name will take the user to desired web page.

Each recipe page displays a detailed breakdown of the information pertinant to the recipe. This includes information such as the recipe name, description, images, original source, and other at-a-glance information.

The navigation bar present on each page shows basic website navigation between the different recipe categories. The recipes sorted between 4 different categories: all recipes, cookies, savory, sweets.
