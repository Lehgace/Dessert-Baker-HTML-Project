        <p class="pad">We took our favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe and increased the brown sugar to make these cookies extra moist and chewy. Then we super-sized them -- the better to get in more of our favorite candy-coated chocolates. Save some extra candy for topping each cookie before baking. The result, cookies that look just as good as they taste!</p><!--Recipe Description-->

            <p>
                <b>Ingredients</b><br>
                2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
                1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder <br>
                1 teaspoon baking soda <br>
                1 teaspoon kosher salt <br>
                2 1/2 sticks (1 1/4 cup) unsalted butter, softened <br>
                1 3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar <br>
                1/4 cup granulated sugar <br>
                2 large eggs, at room temperature <br>
                2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract <br>
                2 cups candy-coated chocolates, such as M&M's<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Instructions</b><br>
                1. Sift the flour, baking powder, baking
                soda and salt into a large bowl.<br><br>
                2. Beat the butter, brown sugar and
                granulated sugar in a bowl with a
                mixer on medium-high speed until pale and
                fluffy, about 4 minutes. Beat in the eggs
                one at a time until smooth, then beat in
                the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low.
                Add the flour mixture and beat until
                combined. Reserve 1/4 cup of the
                chocolates, then stir in the remaining 1
                3/4 cups of chocolates by hand. Press
                plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the
                dough and refrigerate until chilled through,
                about 1 hour. <br><br>
                3. Arrange the racks in the upper and
                lower third of the oven and preheat to
                350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with
                parchment paper.  <br><br>
                4. Roll the dough into 24 balls, each
                about 3 tablespoons (alternatively,
                use a #20 large cookie scoop). Place 6
                dough balls on each of the prepared
                baking sheets; stud the top of each dough
                ball with some of the reserved chocolates.
                Bake 2 trays at a time until the cookies are
                golden around the edges but still soft in
                the middle, rotating the trays halfway
                through, 15 to 18 minutes. Remove from
                the oven and let cool 10 minutes on the
                baking sheets, then transfer to wire racks
                to cool completely. Repeat with the
                remaining dough and chocolates.<br><br>
